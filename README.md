## Chase Peterson Portfolio

A simple, custom portfolio page built for Chase Peterson to present the work and projects he's done.

This was built with Next.js using TailwindCSS and responsive design. Several sections are included to be easily extendible.

The code is a bit messy for a first version, but will be cleaned up and extended over time.
